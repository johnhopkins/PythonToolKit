This is a basic bi section search down to a degree of accuracy set by epsilon.
Currently set to calculate square roots, can be easily altered to search strings, lists, dictionaries etc. What matters here is the underlying principle of the search and how it cuts the search area in half each time until it finds an answer that is within the desired accuaracy.
